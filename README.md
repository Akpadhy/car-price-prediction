# Car's price prediction
Want to buy or sell a car? What is adequate price? Machine learning to the rescue!

[![passat](passat.jpg)](passat_b6_tdi_price_prediction.ipynb) 

This Python's script uses linear regression model (scikit-learn) to predict adequate price for a given car.
As a data source (train&test) it uses real offers from Poland's biggest online vehicle marketplace. 

To predict the best price you will need to specify 3 features:
* year
* mileage [km]
* engine capacity [ccm]
